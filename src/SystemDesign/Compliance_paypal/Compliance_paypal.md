### COMPLIANCE - PAYPAL - SIMPLIFIED CASE MANAGEMENT TOOL

As the SCM platform is primarily meant to build in-house case management systems, it is natural that different use cases 
might have the need to develop similar features. For example, multiple clients might want to develop a page form which restrictions can be applied to an account.
If this feature is pre-developed in a configurable way, it is possible for SCM platform clients to on-board this feature without having to deal with the complexity as it will be available as a widget. This can reduce time and effort needed by SCM clients to develop features which have already been created.

## Where will the widgets be hosted?
Widgets will be hosted in a separate NPM module. Any SCM Platform client can add the widgets module as a dependency to their nodeweb client  and use the widgets.

## About CaseFile

Case File is a data consolidation tool that is leveraged by investigative teams to supplement their case investigation processes, subpoena requests, and filings to law enforcement. This tool is currently leveraged by over 600+ investigative teammates - and is used as supporting documents to determine suspicious actors on the PayPal platform. Case File currently consolidates PayPal Inc data in a consumable format to the investigators. This data request is based/driven by account ids that are suspicious through the investigative process.
Usecase
We will need to migrate to BQ datasources due to high cpu resource consumption for ADMC oracle queries.

As part of this migration, first PayPal transaction data is planned for migration to be consumed from BQ datasources through CCTS transaction APIs
