We heard the question from many engineers and colleagues on cci, casefile and transaction viewer (aka ag grid). Inspired by "Head First" series of books, just thought we will try to explain it in a different way rather than bullets. Hopefully it makes the diffference clear.



Interviewer : Ladies & Gentleman, welcome to our session to learn about Investigation tools from eminent panelist of casefile, CCI & Transaction Viewer (TV).

Interviewer : Thank You Casefile, CCI & TV for taking your time to join us today. Its absolute pleasure to host you today and we hope to get to know better about you today.

Interviewer : Let me start with you Casefile first. You have been serving our investigators for quite sometime now and they all go ga-ga over you and have lot off praise on how you help them day in and day out. How do you feel.

##### Casefile : Thanks for having me here. I have been with PayPal since 2017 and i was told that before me they had to run places to get the data needed for investigation. I quite cannot imagine a world like that. But after i arrived my endeavour has always been to provide a` _**one stop shop`_** solution for our investigators. They should focus their efforts on investigation and not on data gathering.

Interviewer : That’s awesome, i can now understand all the praise that you get and you deserve it completely. How do you do that ?

Casefile : Well, its quite a complex process behind the scenes. But to keep it simple i have connects with multiple folks within PayPal some of them are Rest based and some are DB based and over the period of time i have figured out to work with them efficiently and they help me with all the data that the investigators look for and obviously i am backed by a smart team of engineers who make sure i can adapt to changes and also maintains my health to serve mankind !

Interviewer : Seems like a whole lot that goes on your head. Have you talked to Transaction Viewer before ?

Casefile : Actually i did hear about him recently, and he seems to be on probation. Did not have time to know more.

Interviewer : Then its right Segway for me to bring in Transaction Viewer (TV). Why dont you introduce yourself TV ?

TV : Thanks for having me here, it's good to sit along side my partners. As you might now, i joined PayPal recently and i am tasked to make the investigator life easy by providing them an easy UI to access Transaction Data. As casefile told, i am on pilot mode now and very energized to see the positive feedback from my customers.

Interviewer : That’s great, welcome to PayPal. How are you different from casefile ?

TV : Excel is so old way of doing things and as you know getting data into a local system will have IS (Info Sec) knocking your doors every now & then. Nobody wants to be in that situation. I want to ensure my customers can access the data on the webpage without having to download anything.

Interviewer : Interesting...

Casefile : Let me tell you few additional differences. I dont provide investigators with just transaction data like TV , i serve them with ALL the data needed for them and my friends from Disputes, Limitations, Risk etc.. help me achieve that noble cause. I have been in service long enough to take my sabbatical shortly and IS has evaluated & certified me. Oh by the way, i am not restricted to PayPal alone, i serve my customers with Xoom & Venmo data as well and before going on sabbatical i will ensure they have Zettle data as well. I hope that gives you the value i bring to the company.

Interviewer : Wow. You are all so very different and it looks very similar from outside... TV, talk to us about your road ahead it looks like casefile is way ahead of you.

TV : Oh yeah ! At this point though. As you might know, i am serving DD customers as of now, and my users are so excited and they have recommended me to SAR, BRM and GI and i am planning to serve them starting next year.

Interviewer : That's ....

Casefile : GI !! Do you even know how many accounts and Transactions GI look at ? I serve them with 2 Million Transactions in one shot and they are asking for more. You must be kidding that your small little table can serve them.

TV : Well casefile, you are right. To give the best experience to my users i have limited myself to serve them less than 100K transactions. When i talked to them 95% of our users are happy with that much information. They appreciate the speed and flexibility. For the remaining 5% you can continue to serve them.

Interviewer : How do you plan to support non transactional data. That seems to be a huge difference isn't ?

CCI : If you dont mind, i can take that question. Hello All, glad to be here. I am CCI and for those of you who dont know me, i am trying to solve the larger Back office problem of providing an unified view of customer data that doesnt change based on tools. I have made myself flexible so that any SCM teams can plug me into their system.

Interviewer : Thank You CCI, you have been the talk of the town recently. Appreciate you joining us today. There seems to be lot off data tools and it begs the question on how are you differnt from others.

CCI : I am very glad you asked that question. I think our Back Office is so huge that it is very difficult to have a one size fits all solutions. As you heard from casefile, there is GI which investigates 1000's of accounts and millions of transactions probably excel is the best way for them. And there are other use cases, a lot off them,  where we investigate smaller frauds with handful of accounts and fewer transactions. Thats where me and TV can play a greater role.

Interviewer : I See. Things seems to be getting clearer CCI.

CCI : Yeah, this is very complex and it confuses many.

Interviewer : How do you plan to partner with TV ?

CCI : Just like casefile, i have made friends with lot off teams within PayPal like Limitations, CJP, Risk etc.. and i plan to democratize the data thru a Plug and Play ability which i call as Widgets.  Think of Widget as Lego Blocks. You have one Widget for Limitation, one for Dispute, One for FI etc.. My customers can decide which Widget they would like to have on their system and integrate it. And for those users who want to access me seperately as a stand-alone interface can also do so, i can share my co-ordinates later. All they need is few details like account number or email or phone number they want to search and i will do the rest for them. Let me also tell you that i have a robust AI enabled face recognition ability and i would not provide sensitive data to people whom i don’t trust.

Interviewer : But i dont think you have answered the question on your partnership with TV ?

CCI : Oh Yeah Sorry, apologize for that. TV has a great ability that enables his customers to slice and dice the data in real-time. This functionality is much needed when transaction data is analyzed. TV is part of my family since he is also a Widget and any of the SCM instances can use him like any other widget. We complement each other. I have all non transactional data and TV brings the transactional data. Together we are confident of serving majority of the back office needs.

Interviewer : Why do you say "majority" and not "ALL" ?

CCI : Both me & TV have been here only for a short while, we need some time to onboard Xoom, Venmo etc.. into our widgets. Till that time, we need casefile to support those customers. Additionally as i told before there are very niche use cases like GI where we may need casefile, sometimes we also submit profile & transaction data to Law Enforcement where casefile is much easier to use. In addition to that, there "seems" to be some complex models on analyzing chemical purchases for terrorist use etc.. wherein casefile is used. We may eventually find a way to download CCI data into excel but for now i think we will leave those to the expertise of casefile.



Interviewer : Well, thats all we have time for today. Thank you once again CCI, TV & Casefile for joining us today. It has been an enlightening discussion. Good Bye !
