combination of relational databases, NoSQL databases, and distributed storage systems.

## Relational Databases for Structured Data

## NoSQL Databases for Unstructured Data
Spotify generates recommendations for users based on their listening behavior and this data is updated frequently.

Example Record:

earch indices are stored in NoSQL databases like Elasticsearch to allow quick, fuzzy search queries across songs, artists, and albums.

These indices are continuously updated as new content is added.

## Distributed Storage System like Amazon s3 for storing large volumes of audio and ad files

**Caching  Estimation**

Caching plays a significant role in reducing the load on the storage system and ensuring low latency for popular content.

Frequently played song metadata can be cached in memory.

Lets assume top 20% songs contribute to 80% of the requests.

Assuming Spotify has 100 million songs and the top 20% are cached.

Cache size = 20 million songs √ó 2 KB/song = 40 GB.

## **Storage**
Databases: Stores user profiles, playlists, songs metadata and search indices.

Blob Storage: A distributed storage system (e.g., AWS S3) for handling large-scale storage of audio and ad files.

Content Delivery Network (CDN): Used to deliver large audio files efficiently to users across the globe with minimal latency.

Caches: Caches frequently accessed data such as popular songs and recommendations to improve performance and reduce the load on the storage and database systems.

##  Analytics and Monitoring Data (Data Warehousing)
Analytics and monitoring data are critical for tracking user engagement, system performance, and identifying potential issues.

Data is aggregated and processed in a data warehouse or distributed data stores (e.g., Hadoop, BigQuery).

**Key Use Cases for Analytics:**

User Engagement: Data on streams, skips, and playlist additions are used to generate insights into user behavior.

System Monitoring: Logs from various services are used to monitor system health, detect anomalies, and perform performance tuning.

#### **Royalty Calculations:** Streaming data is used to calculate payments for artists based on song plays and geographic reach.

##  Recommendation Service

####   1.Recommendation Service 
    User-Based Collaborative Filtering, Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

#### 2. Content-Based Filtering
    Song Attributes,Artist Similarity

## üìå Search Service
The architecture of Search Service can be broken down into the following key components:
        
     Query Parser,Search Index,Ranking Engine,Personalization Layer,
     Search Autocomplete,Cache Layer,Search Index Updater
